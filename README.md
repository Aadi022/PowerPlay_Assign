# DevOps Intern Assignment

This repository contains a set of hands-on DevOps tasks performed on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu `t2.micro` instance.  
Each part focuses on a specific area of basic DevOps workflows:

- EC2 environment and user setup
- Web server configuration and metadata usage
- System monitoring with shell scripting and cron
- Integration with AWS CloudWatch Logs using AWS CLI
- Bonus: Alerting using Amazon SNS for high disk usage

The repository is organized into five folders:

- `Part1/` – Environment and user setup
- `Part2/` – Simple web service with Nginx and instance metadata
- `Part3/` – System monitoring script and scheduled execution
- `Part4/` – Pushing logs to CloudWatch Logs via AWS CLI
- `Bonus/` – SNS-based disk usage alerting

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed steps and commands.
